Font Weights:

Bold for headers (e.g., "Find your favorite place here")

Regular for body text (email/password fields)

Large size (~24–32px) for headers

Medium (~16–18px) for normal text and buttons

Small (~12–14px) for captions (e.g., “Forgot Password?”, "Join now")

Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding the color styles, typography, and design properties of a mockup ensures consistency throughout the project. It allows developers and designers to maintain the same look and feel across different pages and components. It also speeds up the development process, improves collaboration, and creates a more professional and polished final product. Proper alignment to the mockup builds trust with users and ensures a cohesive user experience across the platform.


Listing Detailed View	Shows full details of a selected property, including images, amenities, location map, availability calendar, and a "Book Now" button.
Simple Checkout View	A minimal page where users confirm their booking by entering basic details (name, dates, payment info) and completing the reservation.
Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is crucial in a booking system because it reduces friction, builds trust, and improves the likelihood of users completing a booking. Clear layouts, intuitive navigation, and quick load times create a better user experience, leading to higher customer satisfaction and better conversion rates.
