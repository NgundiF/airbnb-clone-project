Primary Pages Overview

Listing Detailed View	Shows full details of a selected property, including images, amenities, location map, availability calendar, and a "Book Now" button.
Simple Checkout View	A minimal page where users confirm their booking by entering basic details (name, dates, payment info) and completing the reservation.
Importance of User-Friendly Design

Clear layouts, intuitive navigation, and quick load times create a better user experience, leading to higher customer satisfaction and better conversion rates.
